TIANJIN: 2016 September (2 weeks); 2017 December (2 weeks); 2018 December (2 weeks). As a native speaker of Tianjin Mandarin, I have long-lasting enthusiasm in understanding the prosody in Tianjin. This project contains some semi-frame tasks and naturalistic speech and conversation collected in 2026-2018.
