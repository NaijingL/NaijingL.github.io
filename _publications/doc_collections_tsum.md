TSUM: 2016 June-September (3.5 months); 2017 June-July (4 weeks): 2018 October-November (5 weeks); 2024 July (2 weeks). This collection contains elicited data and some semi-frame tasks conducted since the beginning of my PhD. It also covers some ethnographic topics reflecting traditional livelihood, such as food preparation, house building, yak breeding etc. With the recent accepted grant from ELF, the Tsum documentation collection is still ongoing. Some audio and video recordings and photos (ttz0079-0082) are collected from Tsum Valley. Due to the covid and other constraints, some documentation work of Tsum had to carry out in Kathmandu and online.
